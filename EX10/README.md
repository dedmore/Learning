Exercise 10, What Was That? The introduction of escape sequences.

Study Drills

1.	Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.

2.	Use ''' (triple-single-quote) instead. Can you see why you might use that instead of """?

3.	Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.

4.	Remember the %r format? Combine %r with double-quote and single-quote escapes and print them out. Compare %r with %s. Notice how %r prints it the way you'd write it in your file, but %s prints it the way you'd like to see it?

In response to #1, I have most of them and will continue to memorize them all. They are also at the bottom of this page. #2, ex10-q2.py. #3, ex10-q3.py. #4, ex10-q4.py, Yes I did notice the differences in how things would work when writing to a file.
