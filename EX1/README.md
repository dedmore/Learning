Not much to explain here, using the print command to get text to display. Exercise 1 for me is about understanding what extension the file needs to work best with Python as well and getting to be free of the strict confines of C++. There is a section called study Drills from the guide that I will address here as well.

For this exercise, try these things:
1.	Make your script print another line.
2.	Make your script print only one of the lines.
3.	Put a '#' (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

In response to the first one, this is quite simple. Just adding another line of code with “print” at the beginning will display the text on the screen. For the second one, I was left with a question. Do you want the lines of code to still be there or not? If I can remove the extra lines of code, this will be quite simple to accomplish. Otherwise I would attempt to comment them out of processing by using the “//” function in C++, but I must learn what the syntax for that is in Python. For number three, this appears to be the same function as “//” in C++. An "octothorpe" is also called a "pound", "hash", "mesh", or any number of names.
