Exercise 2, helps to understand what the “#” character is and what it does. There are a few different names that it can go by so pick one that works best for you. An "octothorpe" is also called a "pound", "hash", "mesh", or any number of names.

1.	Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

2.	Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.

3.	Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

4.	Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

In response to #1, yes I was correct about the character and I’m choosing to use “octothorpe” as well for the name. #2, I didn’t find any problems. #3, No. #4, No.
