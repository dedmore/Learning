Exercise 5, More Variables and Printing. This exercise talks about formating a string. It also shows how you would address variables inside a string and how to use formatters.

Study Drills:

1.	Change all the variables so there isn't the my_ in front. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

2.	Try more format characters. %r is a very useful one. It's like saying "print this no matter what."

3.	Search online for all of the Python format characters.

4.	Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilos. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.

In response to #1, I created ex5-myremoved.py. #2, ex5-formatr.py. #3, %d and %i are signed integer decimal, %o is Signed octal value, %x and %X is Signed hexadecimal, %e and %E are floating point exponential format, %f and %F are Floating point decimal format, %c is single character, %r does string conversion using repr(), and %s does string conversion using str(). #4, ex5-q4.py.
