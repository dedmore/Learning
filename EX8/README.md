Exercise 8, Printing, Printing. In this exercise a different way of using strings is presented. The use of %r is also known as “representation” that will give you the “raw programmer’s” version of the variable.

Study Drills

1.	Do your checks of your work, write down your mistakes, and try not to make them on the next exercise.

2.	Notice that the last line of output uses both single-quotes and double-quotes for individual pieces. Why do you think that is?

In response to #1, just the usual typographical errors. #2, Python will print strings in the most efficient way it can, this can lead you seeing extra quote marks in the output, but this is mostly for debugging and inspection.
