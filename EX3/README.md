Exercise 3, Numbers and Math. I didn’t really come across any new information as of yet. Maybe in the Study Drills I’ll learn something to point out… In the guide it asks to find the missing operations for a few mathematical symbols:

[+ plus : Does Addition.
[- minus : Does Subtraction.
[/ slash : Does Division.
[* asterisk : Does Multiplication.
[% percent : Does Modulus (Grabs the remainder of a division operation.)
[< less-than : Checks first number against second number and returns true or false.
[> greater-than : Checks first number against second number and returns true or false.
[<= less-than-equal : Checks first number against second number and returns true or false.
[>= greater-than-equal : Checks first number against second number and returns true or false.

Study Drills:
1.	Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
2.	Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Python? Start Python this way again and using the above characters and what you know, use Python as a calculator.
3.	Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
4.	Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.
5.	Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point).

In response to #1, I created ex3-commented.py. #2, I used Python as a calculator but I’m not sure how to prove that. #3, I created ex3-calculate.py. #4, The term floating point is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; that is, the decimal point can float. #5, ex3-floatingpoint.py.
