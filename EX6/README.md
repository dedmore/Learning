Exercise 6, Strings and Text. This exercise is about strings and string manipulation. Once again I find the way python does programming to be far less confining the C++. The ability to use either single or double quote to define string text makes python far more usable by many programmers.

Study Drills:

1.	Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.

2.	Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.

3.	Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.

4.	Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer string.

In response to #1, I created ex6-commented.py. #2, ex6-stringinstring.py. #3, I found what may be a fifth place where a string is inside a string. I commented this in ex6-stringinstring.py. #4, to me this is just printing the stings one after another looking like a single piece of information. If the result was stored into a variable, I would say they have been added.
